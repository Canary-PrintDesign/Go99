<p>2.4 <b>Application and Activation:</b> Subject to these Terms, Member may apply for an Account using the processes made available for that purpose by Go99.

If Member’s application for an Account is accepted by Go99, then Member’s Account will remain inactive and unable to use Services unless and until Go99 in its discretion activates the Account after Member complies with the prescribed activation procedures. Member hereby consents to Go99 making reasonable inquiries and investigations (including inquiries with credit reporting agencies, public databases and government agencies) that Go99 considers appropriate to verify the information and documentation provided by or on behalf of Member and to determine whether to accept Member’s application for an Account or to activate Member’s Account.

<p>2.5 <b>Representations/Warranties by Member:</b> By submitting an application for an Account, Member represents and warrants that: (a) Member has all requisite power, capacity, authority and approvals required for Member to lawfully accept these Terms and to lawfully perform Member’s obligations and lawfully exercise Member’s rights under these Terms; and (b) Member’s acceptance of these Terms and performance of Member’s obligations and exercise of Member’s rights under these Terms will not conflict with, or result in the breach of, any express or implied obligation or duty (contractual or otherwise) now or in the future owed by Member to any other person.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref475030859">2.6 <b>Information/Documentation: </b>To apply for, activate and use an Account, Member will be required to provide certain information and documentation and give certain authorizations or instructions to Go99. Member will ensure that all information and documentation provided by or on behalf of Member to Go99 regarding Member’s application for an Account, the activation and use of Member’s Account and each Authorized User is true, accurate, current and complete. Member will immediately update that information and documentation, using applicable online processes available through the Go99 Website or the Marketplace, to accurately record any changes to the information and documentation. Go99 will rely on the information and documentation provided by or on behalf of Member. Go99 is not obligated to verify the truth, accuracy, currency or completeness of any information or documentation provided by or on behalf of Member, but Go99 in its discretion may do so, and Member hereby consents to Go99 making reasonable inquiries and investigations that Go99 considers appropriate to verify the information and documentation provided by or on behalf of Member.

<p><a name="_Ref475614497">2.7 <b>Deactivation/Suspension of Account:</b> Member for its sole convenience may give notice to Go99 at any time requesting that Go99 restrict the functionality of Member’s Account so that the Account can no longer be used to make a Contract of Carriage. Go99 for its sole convenience may suspend or deactivate Member’s Account effective immediately without any notice to Member or any other person if Go99 reasonably believes that Member has breached these Terms. Deactivation or suspension of Member’s Account will automatically prevent Member from making any Contracts of Carriage, but will not result in the termination of these Terms or any previously made Contract of Carriage.</a></p>

<p>2.8 <b>Authorized Users:</b></p>

<p>(a) <b>General:</b> Subject to these Terms, Member will access and use Services only through one or more Authorized Users, each of whom is authorized by Member to use Services on Member’s behalf, to give information, instructions and documents to Go99 and other Registered Users on Member’s behalf, and to enter into binding agreements with Go99 and other Registered Users on Member’s behalf. Member will ensure that each Authorized User accesses and uses Services only on behalf of Member and strictly in accordance with the restrictions and requirements set out in these Terms.

Member will ensure that each Authorized User keeps the Authorized User’s Credentials secure and confidential at all times, does not permit any other person to use the Authorized User’s Credentials, and immediately notifies Go99 if the Authorized User knows or suspects that any Credentials have become known to or used by any other person.

Go99 in its discretion may require an Authorized User to verify or change the Authorized User’s Credentials from time to time.</p>

<p>(e) <b>Instructions/Authority:</b> Go99 may accept and act on any information, instruction or document provided through Member’s Account or given by an Authorized User or using an Authorized User’s Credentials. Go99 is not under any obligation to verify the actual identity or authority of any person accessing or using Member’s Account or using Credentials, but Go99 in its discretion may at any time require verification of the identity and authority of any person accessing or using Member’s Account or using Credentials and may deny access to Member’s Account or refuse to accept or act on any information, instruction or document if Go99 is not satisfied with the verification.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref475031690"><b>3. The Marketplace</b></a></p>

<p>3.1 <b>Application:</b> This section 3 applies only if Member is a Carrier or a Shipper.</p>

<p>3.3 <b>How the Marketplace Works: </b>Member acknowledges as follows:</p>

Each Quote is an offer by the relevant Carrier that is open for acceptance by the relevant Shipper unless and until the Quote is cancelled or is withdrawn by the relevant Carrier using the applicable functionality made available for that purpose by the Marketplace. The relevant Shipper may accept a Quote using the applicable functionality made available for that purpose by the Marketplace. The relevant Shipper is not obligated to accept any Quote (including the lowest price Quote), and may withdraw any of the Shipper’s Shipping Requests at any time or allow those Shipping Requests to expire without accepting any corresponding Quote. If the relevant Shipper accepts a Quote, then the Quote together with the relevant information in the corresponding Shipping Request will constitute a Contract of Carriage between the relevant Shipper and the relevant Carrier. Go99 does not guarantee that a Shipping Request will result in any Quote, or that any Quote will be accepted by the relevant Shipper.</p>

<p><a name="_Ref477182476">(b) <b>Parties to Contract of Carriage:</b> The only parties to a Contract of Carriage are the relevant Shipper and the relevant Carrier. A Driver assigned to a Contract of Carriage is <b>not</b> a party to the Contract of Carriage. Go99 is <b>not</b> a party to any Contract of Carriage. Go99 is not responsible or liable to any Registered User or any other person for any Shipper or Carrier or their performance of any of their obligations or exercise of any of their rights under any Contract of Carriage. These Terms are <b>not</b> part of any Contract of Carriage.</a></p>

<p>(c) <b>Rejection/Cancellation by Go99: </b>Go99 in its discretion and for its sole convenience may accept or reject any Shipping Request. Go99 in its discretion and for its sole convenience may suspend or cancel any Shipping Request at any time effective immediately and without any notice to Member.

If Member is a Shipper or a Carrier, then Member will include the Mandatory Contract Terms in each Contract of Carriage. Go99 in its discretion may change the Mandatory Contract Terms from time to time without any notice to Member by posting a new version of the Mandatory Contract Terms on the Marketplace. Member is solely responsible for checking the “Version Number” at the top of the Mandatory Contract Terms and reviewing and obtaining legal advice regarding any changes since the previous version before Member makes a Contract of Carriage.</p>

<p>3.5 <b>Standard Terms/Conditions:</b></p>

<p>(a) <b>General: </b>Go99 in its discretion may make available through the Marketplace a standard form legal terms and conditions document (the “<b>Standard Terms/Conditions</b>”) that Member (as a Shipper and a Carrier) may agree to incorporate by reference into a Contract of Carriage.

<p>(b) <b>Changes/Review:</b> Go99 in its discretion may change the Standard Terms/Conditions from time to time without any notice to any Shipper or Carrier by posting a new version of the Standard Terms/Conditions on the Marketplace. Member is solely responsible for checking the “Version Number” at the top of the Standard Terms/Conditions and reviewing and obtaining legal advice regarding any changes since the previous version before Member makes a Contract of Carriage that incorporates the Standard Terms/Conditions.</p>
